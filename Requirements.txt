Router:
router will process highest priority message first, so maybe the messages are first sorted and then put in routing table which is just normal queue and it will just send them out normally
make routing tble(idk what that is
so the thing that will beapplied here is that it will use djikstra's algorithm to identify nearest router
and maybe the routing table is the priority queue and that will sort and send out the messages)
outgoing queue is normal queue
routing table will store destinations and where every message is supposed to go
the destination address is what the routing table uses to forward the message to nearest router and from there it goes to another router unless it reaches its destination by djikstra's algorithm
make sure to create destructor for every struct and delete all dynamic memory properly
PHASE 1:
Routing Table:
made linear list, splay tree construction is already underway

consists of 2 fields
destination(read from message)
outgoing queue(the next router the message will be dequeued to)
so basically the routing table is gonna be a whole array of another struct

change RT :
so there can be a whole file which has a whole routing table written on it in csv type format
(all entries are written on it)
make functionality to remove or add a row by taking the input from CLI as:
add M4,R1
remove M4,R2
add rt_1.csv
remove rt_2.csv
okay so this all done^

okay so only 3 things have ID:
the machines, the routers, and the message-s
