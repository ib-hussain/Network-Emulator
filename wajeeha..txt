Incoming Queue is a heap(priority queue), priority is represented by an int from 1 to 10
so basically a node for this this will have 3 data members:
-Pointer to next node
-short int priority;(10 is highest priority so it should be Dequeued first, then the rest)
-T3 data(where T3 is the name of the variable that represnetns the datatype for data which can be any since we are using templates)
