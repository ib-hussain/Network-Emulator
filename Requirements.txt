Router:
router will process highest priority message first, so maybe the messages are first sorted and then put in routing table which is just normal queue and it will just send them out normally
make routing tble(idk what that is
so the thing that will beapplied here is that it will use djikstra's algorithm to identify nearest router
and maybe the routing table is the priority queue and that will sort and send out the messages)
outgoing queue is normal queue
routing table will store destinations and where every message is supposed to go
the destination address is what the routing table uses to forward the message to nearest router and from there it goes to another router unless it reaches its destination by djikstra's algorithm
make sure to create destructor for every struct and delete all dynamic memory properly
PHASE 1:
a routing table has a destination, next best router address  make routing table
make linear list, splay tree construction is already underway

figure out what the change RT thing means
